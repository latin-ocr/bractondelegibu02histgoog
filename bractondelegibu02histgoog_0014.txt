viii ratmot,

In so far as the MSS. would permit it we have kept the text of the
printed editions; no innovations have been made merely for the sake of
change. Yet the present text is so different from the older text in so many
particulam that the two are very unlike. A study of the variant readings
given in our footnotcs will show, contrary to what has hitherto been gen-
erally believed, that the unlmown editor οἱ the first edition did, as he said,
consult a good many MSS„ unless—what is hardly probable—his text
happened to be taken from a MS. which had been compared with many
other Mss.‚ and in which many emendations had been made. It is apparent
at once that at one time the old text (we designate it by the letter V)
follows one tradition ns a basis, and at another time another. It is very
evident, too, that in many places a deliberate choice of readings has been
made between oonflicting traditions; less frequently, conflicting readings
have been combined into one. Usually the readings of V which stand alone
against the MSS. collated for our text have not been given in the footnotes.
They are far too numerous to permit οὶ this. Where V agrees with one
group of MSS. as against mother group, the reading of V is often indi-
cated for the purpose of showing the probahle source of that reading. In
a single instance or two the reading of V has been retained though not sup-
ported hy the MSS. collated—this raet being duly noted and the reason for
it being obvious.

No attempt has been made to give all the variant readings in all the
MSS. collated. Even the best of MSS. often differ from the text in places
where the dem'ded agreement of the other MSS. proves the text to be eor-
rect. The recording of all the variant readings of all the MSS. used would
make an unweildy mass of immaterial facts as unnecessary ss it is undesir-
able. It was shown in the first volume that with some few exceptions, which
are aelf-evident, only those variant readings which represent groups of
MSS. or text traditions are important in determining Braaeton's text. This
being so, and because the actual reading of any single tradition is seldom
in doubt, it seemed only necessary in most places to give merely those
variants which have the authority of the group behind them. Without the
curb of this limitation the references made to the MSS„ now more than
twenty-three thousand in number, would have been at least doubled.

On the basis of the pedigree worked out in the first volume—to which
the reader is referred—the following MSS. were selected as representing
the three main text trsditions there indicated: OA, OB, OC, MA, ΜΒ,
MC, MG, CE, CM, LA, Y. These have been used throughout; from time
to time reference has been made to other MSS. We may note in passing
that the assertions made in Vol. 1 in regard to pedigree have been fully
borne out by the mure extensive collation of these MSS.
