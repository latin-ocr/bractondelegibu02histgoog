PREFACE

HIS volume contains nothing but the Latin text, with variant read·-

ings‚ of a portion of Bracton's book. When the first volume of the
work was published, and for some time afterwards, it was hoped that a
commentary might aoeompany each portion of text. But the amount of
commentary necessary for anything like an adequate treatment of Brac-
ton's subject-matter bulked so large that it was thought expedient to
reserve that feature of the work until the publication of the entire text
should make it possible to devote a whole book, ir necessary, to commen-
tar-y alone. The explanation of the arrangement of the text as here given
will be found in Vol. Ι, 45-50, 60-61.

The object ot* this volume is to present, as nearly as may be, the text oi*
the De Legibus as it final-ly left Bracton’s hands. This does not at all neces-
sarily mean the making· of what might he considered the beet text from the
stmdpoint οἰ law or history or language, on the basis of everything and
anything which may be found in any and every MS. All the MSS. have
been emended in places more or less numerous to make better, or sup-
posedly better, sense or more grammatical constructione. But the original
cannot be reoonstructed merely by emendations and arbitrary selections
froin the variant readings. In the first volume it was pointed out that for
at least the larger portion of the text there were three principa! traditione.
It is on the basis of these traditione, and not on the readings of individual
MSS„ that the restoration of the original text must rest. That there were
mistakes of one kind or another in Branton's own copy of his treatise is
more than likely; it was a text o! great lengthr and left unfinished at his
death; under the circumstances in which it seems to have been oomposed
it would have been practically impossible for him to have handed down to
posterity a perfect piece of work. Consequently. it need cause no surprise
that the readings which on the authority oi* the MSS. must be accepted as
Bracton’s own, are not always what, from the context, we might expect
or desire. For the most part we have devoted but little space to emenda-
tions, passing by what are clearly mere corrections in individua] MSS„ and
inserting but few οἰ our own. It has se-ed preferable to discuss trouble-
some readings in the commentam, rather than on insuffleient manuscript
authority to alter them in the text.
