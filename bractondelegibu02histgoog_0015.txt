PREFACE ix

A word of explanation is demanded by the rubrica. Whether or not
Bractnn himself wrote the rubrics‚ and whatever may have been their posi-
tion and importante in the original MS„ all the MSS. now extant have
them. Therefore in reprodueing this feature we are making the text appear
as it must prsetically always have appeared to users of Broeton MSS. from
the beginning. It was planned to give variant readings for the rubries as
for the text, but the plan was abandoned after the necessary collation had
shown that the use of the large amount of space which would be required
to indicate the results of this collation would not be justified by the con-
fused md indefinite character of these results. A few facts in regard to
the rubrics should be kept in mind, however. Not every MS. has a table of
rubrics at the beginnin3; in many MSS. the kalendar has been copied
from a source different from that of the text, the rubries of the kalendar
agreeing with one tradition and those in the text with anathem even when
seemingly from the same tradition, the rubrics in the two places may vary
great1y; in but a very few of the MSS. do the rubrius in the kalendar agree
with those in the text. In different MSS. the same rubrio may be used for
different places in the *ext—places near together or far spart. It did not
seem necessary to indicate where these breaks in the text occurred in indi-
vidual MSS„ some of them being clearly accidental, and the MSS. for the
most part being in harmony as to where the breaks and the rubrica should
come.

For the adadorum, the list in Vol. 1, 872-422, should always be consulted
in connection with the text as given here. The preparation of this second
volume has resulted in the discovery of a very few more additional passages
which may be added to that list. These are all given in the text and have
been marked in the usual way. It is hardly necessary to warn those inter-
ested in the subject that the significance of the variant readings given for
the addiciones ean often be understood only by recalling the fact that it is
not unusual for a MS. to have its text from one tradition md its additiones
from mother.

It is to be hoped that the attempt now under way to bring about a uni-
form orthography in the editing of medieval Latin texts will be successful.
Hitherto there has been considerable feeling on that point but no uniform-
ity. In the absence of a well-remgnized and suthoritative set of rules, the
matter resolves itself largely into a question of expediency for each editor.
Or the situation may be oontrolled by the nature of the document or the
manuscript material. Where a medieval Latin document or text existing
in only a single MS. is to be printed, all the arguments are in favor of
making an exact reproduction of that MS. The situation is not at all the
same where the text to be edited is found in scores of MSS. of different
