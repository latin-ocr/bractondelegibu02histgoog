periods and characteristics. From the standpoint of orthography‚ the same
editor may adopt different pians in different circumstances. A good illus-
tration of this is to be found in the csse of Βναιήιηιέ Note Book and
Bractoen and Azo. The first of these lind to do with a. single MS.; it was
printed with its medieval word forms intact. The second was concerned
with two medieval texts, each found in many manuscripts spread over
several generations. Here the modern spelling of Latin words was used.
To us there seems nothing illogical in this difference between the two
books. Were Bracton’s own copy of the Dc Leqibvu available, we should
insist on its being reproduced as the single MS. of the Note Book was
reproduoed. But Brocton's original MS. has disappeared2 we are under
the necessity of using a considerable number of MSS. in place of it; we are
confronted with sll the vagaries of medieval spelling und punctuation. We
are able to restore with practically no misgivings the important thing,
Brscton’s own words; yet often we can not feel st all certain as to the exact
form of these words as they left his pen. When in one and the same place
among the oldest surviving descendants of the original MS. we find the
same word spelled in three, four, five, or even six different ways, we may
well hesitate to ascribe to Bracton himself any single one of these forms.
Under all the circumstances that have to be taken into consideration, it has
seemed best to us to follow in general the plan adopted by all the editors
of Brscton’s treatise in the past. We have therefore given classical or pre*
medieval words their now generally accepted form. For purely medieval
words we have chosen that form most usually found in the MSS.

One word should, perhaps, be referred to in particular. For the dative
and nhlstive plural of the demonstrative pronoun the MSS. give either eis
or Ην, the forms iis and hin never occurring (except, infrequently, hia for ἡ
in the nominative singular). From the fact that hee (ιω) and heedem
(eaedem) are the usual manuscript forms of these words, it might soem thst
hiis was meant for hie. Yet the hia of the Romen law passages quoted ver-
batim by Brscton invariably becomes hiis in the MSS. of his work; in these
and other MSS. from the same period heio regularly occurs where we should
expect Ma,- the hia found in the earlier (late XIIth-early XIIItb cent.)
MS. of Glanvill becomes hiis in the later (late XIIIth-esrly XIVth cent.)
MSS. of the same trestise. We have therefore uniformly given to the hiis
of the MSS. the torm hia.

Though we could not impose upon the kindness of our colleagues by
uking them to undertake the thsnkless task of reading proof for this
volume, we have nevertheless not hesitated to ask their advice at sundry
times in regard to matters connected with it. For the help frcely md gladly
given we again tender our thanks. We are especially indebted to Professor
